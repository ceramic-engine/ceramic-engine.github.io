**Visual Studio Code** is the _**official**_ way of working with ceramic projects. If you donâ€™t have it installed, [go download and install it](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

Then, open VSCode and install the [Ceramic extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jeremyfa.ceramic):

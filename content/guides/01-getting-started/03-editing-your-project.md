# Editing your project

**Visual Studio Code** is the _**official**_ way of working with ceramic projects. If you don’t have it installed, [go download and install it](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

Then, open VSCode and install the [Ceramic extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jeremyfa.ceramic):

<div class="caption">How to install the Ceramic extension from Visual Studio Code</div>
</p>

At this point, you should be ready to work on your project.

Open it from Visual Studio Code: **File** > **Open…** > choose `myproject` folder. It should display the following project window:

![Ceramic project VSCode](/static/img/ceramic-project-vscode.png)

Code completion in Haxe files (`*.hx`) should work too.

## What’s inside the project?

<table>
    <tr>
        <td><code>.haxelib/</code></td>
        <td>Ceramic automatically initializes a local haxelib repository for every project you create. Haxe libraries are installed locally on this directory and won’t affect the rest of your environment. This is done to ensure every project build is more reproducible and won’t break because of your machine configuration. <code>.haxelib/</code> contains all your project’s haxe libraries.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><code>.vscode/</code></td>
        <td>Contains Visual Studio Code configuration files. Default files are generated by ceramic with settings ready to use.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><code>assets/</code></td>
        <td>Contains your project’s asset files that will be embedded with the app. Put your images, audio files, etc… inside this folder. The sample project comes with a single image asset to display the logo you’ve seen when running it (with two resolutions: <code>ceramic.png</code> and <code>ceramic@2x.png</code> for high density display).</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><code>gen/</code></td>
        <td>Contains Haxe files generated by ceramic. You are not supposed to edit them manually but they are needed to make your project work. These files give you statically typed assets (like <code>Images.CERAMIC</code> to reference our <code>ceramic.png</code> asset), platform specific bindings for iOS or Android etc… Additional ceramic plugins can generate more files here. If you delete this folder, it will be regenerated again at next build.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><code>out/</code></td>
        <td>Contains intermediate build files that ceramic is creating when building your project. You can safely delete this folder as needed. Ceramic will regenerate it when building.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><code>project/</code></td>
        <td>Contains platform specific project/exported files. For instance, if you build for iOS, it will generate an Xcode project and put it inside this folder (<code>project/ios/</code>). If you export for Unity, the Unity project will be added here as well (<code>project/unity/</code>) etc… On the sample project, we only built for web target, so it generated a web folder with the exported html/js/asset files, but ceramic will add additional folders as needed if you build for other targets.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><code>src/</code></td>
        <td>Your actual project source files! That’s where you will edit and add new Haxe files to create your app/game.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><code>src/Project.hx</code></td>
        <td>This is the entry point of your app. <code>Project.init()</code> is called with a <code>settings</code> object as argument. You can configure the settings as needed and listen to the <code>ready</code> event. Once the <code>ready</code> event is fired, your ceramic app is ready to run. In the default <code>Project.hx</code> file, a <code>ready()</code> method is bound to the <code>app.ready</code> event. A scene object is created and displayed from that method.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><code>src/MainScene.hx</code></td>
        <td><code>MainScene</code> is an example of ceramic scene. It contains the code to load and display a ceramic logo. It is created by the <code>Project</code> class and assigned as main scene. You can change its content as you want, or create another <code>Scene</code> subclass that you will initialize from <code>Project.hx</code> in place of the existing one.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><code>src/import.hx</code></td>
        <td>Contains imports that will be effective on all the haxe files in this folder. The sample project already imports some ceramic helpers that are convenient to be accessible from every file.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><code>.gitignore</code></td>
        <td>A generated <code>.gitignore</code> file properly configured to work with your ceramic project.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><code>ceramic.yml</code></td>
        <td>Your main project configuration file. This is where you add haxe libraries, enable additional ceramic plugins and configure build flags. There is a wiki page about this <a href="https://github.com/ceramic-engine/ceramic/wiki/ceramic.yml">ceramic.yml</a> file that you are strongly encouraged to check out.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><code>completion.hxml</code></td>
        <td>This file is generated by ceramic to let the Haxe compiler provide proper code completion of your project. As it is generated, you are not supposed to modify it manually. Instead, edit <code>ceramic.yml</code> as needed and <code>completion.hxml</code> will be updated accordingly.</td>
    </tr>
</table>

## Run the project from VSCode

To run your project from Visual Studio Code, press `CTRL` + `Shift` + `B` (`CMD` + `Shift` + `B` on Mac).

It should show you the same app window with ceramic logo as when you ran your project from command line.

_Ceramic comes bundled with an [electron](https://www.electronjs.org/) runner, which is used to launch the web export of your app. It takes care of setting up an HTTP server on the fly and creates a window to display your app in a more “native” fashion. This means that when you want to test the web version of you app, you don’t need to manage an HTTP server yourself and don’t have to open some random browser tab that points to your local address. Everything is handled for you!_

## Creating your first Scene

At this point, you should have a Ceramic project that you can edit through VSCode, so let's create our very first scene to practise a bit!

Create a new file called `GettingStarted.hx` inside the `src/` folder:

<div class="codename">GettingStarted.hx</div>

```haxe
import ceramic.Scene;

class GettingStarted extends Scene {

    override function create() {

        log.debug('Hello!');

    }

}
```

Then let’s modify our `ready()` method in `Project.hx` so that it will run our new scene instead of the default one:

<div class="codename">Project.hx</div>

```haxe
    function ready() {

        // Set our new GettingStarted scene as the main scene
        app.scenes.main = new GettingStarted();

    }
```

Let’s try to run that. It should show a black empty window, and a purple **“Hello!”** log should be printed inside VSCode terminal. That means our scene has been initialized and `create()` method called!

![Empty Hello log](/static/img/empty-hello-log.png)

<p>You can log different kind of messages with ceramic: <code class="code-purple">log.debug()</code>, <code class="code-yellow">log.warning()</code>, <code class="code-red">log.error()</code>, <code class="code-blue">log.info()</code> and <code class="code-green">log.success()</code>. Each kind of message will show up with a different color on the terminal.</p>

### Your Scene is now ready to add more content

We managed to setup a project with a new empty scene, which is a very good starting point to add more code to display objects on screen. The next guide will show you just that!

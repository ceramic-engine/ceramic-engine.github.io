# Display an image

In the previous guide, we learned to use `Quad` objects to display plain colored squares or rectangles, but they can also be textured to display images.

We will do that by adding an image file into our `assets/` folder and load it into our scene. Iâ€™ll use a PNG file of the [Haxe logo](/static/img/haxe-logo.png) (named `haxe-logo.png`) in my example.

Download the PNG file from the link above, then put it inside your projectâ€™s assets/ folder (you can also try with another image if you want).

## Loading the image

In our `GettingStarted` scene (created in the previous guides), letâ€™s add a new `preload()` method right before the `create()` method:

<div class="codename">GettingStarted.hx</div>

```haxe
import ceramic.Color;
import ceramic.Quad;
import ceramic.Scene;

class GettingStarted extends Scene {

    override function preload() {

        // Load haxe logo image
        assets.add(Images.HAXE_LOGO);

    }

    override function create() {

...
```

The `preload()` method is called when the scene is preloading. During preload, you can use the sceneâ€™s asset manager (the `assets` object) to make it load the assets your want.

Ceramic generates constant types from asset files (here we got `Images.HAXE_LOGO` constant from `haxe-logo.png` file). If you type `Images.|` in your code, it will autocomplete with the image assets available:

![Images assets completion](/static/img/images-assets-completion.gif)

Thatâ€™s enough to let ceramic load our image!

Now letâ€™s get back to our `create()` method. We will use a quad again, but this time to display the image we have loaded:

<div class="codename">GettingStarted.hx</div>

```haxe
    override function create() {

        var logo = new Quad();
        logo.texture = assets.texture(Images.HAXE_LOGO);
        logo.pos(width * 0.5, height * 0.5);
        logo.anchor(0.5, 0.5);
        add(logo);

    }
```

This time, instead of setting an explicit size to our quad, we simply assign it a texture from our `assets` object. The quad will automatically set its size to fit the image texture we have assigned.

Then we put that quad at the center of the scene, with its centered anchor, just like what we did with the previous quad example:

![Window Haxe logo](/static/img/window-haxe-logo.png)

Wonderful! You now know how to display images with ceramic ðŸ¤“.

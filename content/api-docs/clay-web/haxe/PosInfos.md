# PosInfos

<div class="type-hierarchy"><strong>haxe.PosInfos</strong> (Typedef)</div>

`PosInfos` is a magic type which can be used to generate position information
into the output for debugging use.

If a function has a final optional argument of this type, i.e.
`(..., ?pos:haxe.PosInfos)`, each call to that function which does not assign
a value to that argument has its position added as call argument.

This can be used to track positions of calls in e.g. a unit testing
framework.

# DynamicAccess

<div class="type-hierarchy"><strong>haxe.DynamicAccess</strong> (Abstract)</div>

DynamicAccess is an abstract type for working with anonymous structures
that are intended to hold collections of objects by the string key.

For example, these types of structures are often created from JSON.

Basically, it wraps `Reflect` calls in a `Map`-like interface.

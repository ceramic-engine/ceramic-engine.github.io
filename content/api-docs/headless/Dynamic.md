# Dynamic

<div class="type-hierarchy"><strong>Dynamic</strong> (Abstract)</div>

`Dynamic` is a special type which is compatible with all other types.

Use of `Dynamic` should be minimized as it prevents several compiler
checks and optimizations. See `Any` type for a safer alternative for
representing values of any type.

A sample showing how to create debug/tools UI with Ceramic.

<p class="extra-info">At the moment, debug UI scroll isn't supported when running as web content inside an iframe of a parent page that scrolls too. Better to try the sample as a <a href="https://ceramic-engine.com/ceramic-samples/immediate-gui/">full page</a> instead!</p>
